HELLO!

*please be careful when downgrading from a newer version to an older one, as it will produce unexpected behaviour since it will still try to use your same database. if you want to downgrade it may require some manual editing of your data, downgrading is not recommended unless you know what you are doing*

this is the Synthona version archive! this is where you can download older builds if you are interested in doing so...

at present the code itself is not bundled in here although in the future that may be something to consider

if you want to download an older version, simply go into the folder for it and download the appropriate installer file!
