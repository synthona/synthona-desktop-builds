1.2.5 CHANGELOG

- changed the SORT order of associations, in the association browser. now they are sorted by most recently accessed. open to feedback on this in particular, in the future there may be some configuration to do with this if there is interest in that. i do think sorting by most recent gives the entire application a better flow than it had before, which is why the change was made
- reversed TEXT node card click actions. now a regular click, will take you to the text node's association page, right click will launch the note. this was done to help the text node functionality better match the rest of the application
- improved responsive css, app looks better now on smaller screens and when it is resized
- some minor changes to the profile page, the sider is now hidden by default just like on the home page
- fixed a bug where if you tried to delete a file node, which was missing the file, you would get an error
- clicking links in the association sider now jumps you to those nodes
- changed the import/export icon from a package to a disc, to give exports/imports a more neutral aesthetic
- changed the "home" and "star" icons on the IObar to the filled versions, because it felt like the right aesthetic choice
